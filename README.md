#Twitter markov

It's been done before, but I've done it again. 

The username of the person we're getting the tweets from, is in the `user` variable in `twitr.py:11`.
You'll need `twitterapi`. Run `twitr.py`, and then run `markov.py` to see what the program generates.

You'll also need some keys. Google that shit.

### TODOs

 - Filter out URLs
 - Handle casing (currently, everything is `lower`ed..)
